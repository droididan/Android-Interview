### Architecture

* **Describe the architecture of your last app.**
* **Describe MVP.**
* **What is presenter?**
* **What is model?**
* **Describe MVC.**
* **What is controller?**
* **Describe MVVM - **The **ViewModel **is the "glue" between the model and views layer. the ViewModel is communicating directly with the XML file in both directions. when the model updated, the corresponding views update as well via the data binding. Google recently introduced this pattern as part of its Architecture Components. \(The ViewModel component is design to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. that means that the ViewModel can survive configuration changes such as screen rotation.

* **Tell something about clean code **Writing ugly bad code is like when you don't know how to speak and people just hate to listen to you. when you speak nice people will love you the other way is they just going to give you critics, plus, badly written codebase is going to make your life more difficult. advantages of writing clean code: **Your code is your responsibility- **when you tell yourself "_who the hell wrote this shit?!" _and you realize that this is you. if you followed design patterns and best practices you could avoid it. **Work in a team **
* **Clean Architecture - **exists at higher abstraction level then the MVC and MVVM presentation architecture patterns. It describes the overall application architecture: how the various layers of an app \(business object, useCases, presenters, data storage and UI\) communicate with on another.
