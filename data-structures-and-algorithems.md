### Data Structures And Algorithms

> The level of questions asked on Data Structures And Algorithms totally depends on the company for which you are applying.

* **ArrayList** -  Resizable-array implementation of List interface. 
* **LinkedList** can contain duplicate elements, maintains insertion order,
* **DoublyLinkedList** - each node contains tow fields called _links, \_that are references to the previous_ and to the \_next node, when deleting a node the previous one getting deleted
* **Stack **The Stack calss reperesent a last-in-first-out \(LIFO\) stack of objects. It extends the class Vector with five operation that allow vector to be treated as a stack.Modifier and Type
  |  | Method and Description |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | `boolean` | [`empty`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#empty%28%29)`()`Tests if this stack is empty. |
  | [`E`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) | [`peek`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#peek%28%29)`()`Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack. |
  | [`E`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) | [`pop`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#pop%28%29)`()`Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function. |
  | [`E`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) | [`push`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#push%28E%29)`(`[`E`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html)`item)`Pushes an item onto the top of this stack. |
  | `int` | [`search`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html#search%28java.lang.Object%29)`(`[`Object`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html)`o)`Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack. |
* **Queue FIFO - **peek\(\) will retrieve the object but will not remove it, add\(\) will insert, poll\(\) will retrieve and remove the elemnt
* **PriorityQueue -** elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering
* **Dynamic** **Programming **must of the time used for optimization. a dynamic programming algo will will examine the previously solved problam and will combine their solutions to give the best solution for the given problem
* **String Manipulation **
* **Binary Tree **its a tree which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the _left_ _child _ and the _right child. _
* **Binary Search Tree **it's like a binary tree but they allow fast lookup. Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, support three main operations: insertion of element, deletion of elements, lookup.
* **Sorting Algorithms **Quick Sort - 
* **Hash Table or Hash Map **[`Hashtable`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html)is [synchronized](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1085709/what-does-synchronized-mean), whereas[`HashMap`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)is not. This makes[`HashMap`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.  
  1. [`Hashtable`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html)does not allow`null`keys or values.[`HashMap`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)allows one`null`key and any number of`null`values.

  1. One of HashMap's subclasses is[`LinkedHashMap`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html), so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order \(which is insertion order by default\), you could easily swap out the[`HashMap`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html)for a[`LinkedHashMap`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html). This wouldn't be as easy if you were using[`Hashtable`](http://java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html).
