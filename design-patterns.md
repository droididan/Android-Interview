Design Patterns

Design Patterns are  these patterns are categorized into 3 main groups:

* **Behavioral Patterns** - born to identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibillity in carrying out this communication.
* **Creational Patterns** - design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation
* **Structural Patterns** - structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

The observer pattern is used to allow an object to publish changes to its state. Other objects subscribe to be immediately notified of any changes. RxJava/Android is doing a great job by using the observer patterns to observe object or views. \(check this [acrticle](https://github.com/idanbar134/into_the_rx) for more information\)
